### Installation

I've just been installing this as an [unpacked, developer extension (see Chrome
docs)](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)

### Usage

Open the extension.

Click to select images you want to download, or click again to deselect. The download button will
save the images to the filename.

The size sliders can filter the images.
